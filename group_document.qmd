You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Here is some random text that I am supposed to write.

Here is a code:

```{r}

```

### s252750 (Sylvia) section

```{r}
xy <- seq(from = -3,
          to = 3, 
          by = 0.01)
expand.grid(x = xy,
            y = xy) |>
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = (1 - x - sin(y^2)),
      y = (1 + y - cos(x^2)))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05,
             shape = 20,
             size = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  coord_polar()
```
